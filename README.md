Addi Technical Test - Data Scientist. 

For the technical test, I followed this process:

1. Conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), detailed in eda.ipynb.
2. Developed a recommendation system model, implemented in modeling.ipynb.
3. Began building an interactive app to test the system, located in app.py, with the recommendations.html template.
